This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## FrontEnd

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `BackEnd`

A minimal backend built in Nodejs using express is provided in api folder. You need to run `node server.js` inside api directory.

### Sample App deployed.

I have also deployed a sample version of the App on github for local testing without having to run a server.

### Todos

1. Complete test coverage
2. Adding Authentication
3. Temporary Client Side Storage like localStorage
4. Dockerising the App
5. Adding a CI/CD pipeline
6. Refactor and eliminate some dead code.
